        <!-- Simplified Summary -->
        <div class="summary-title">Simplified Summary</div>
        <p>The AI Agent Host can be complex given that it involves several aspects such as AI, edge computing, Docker, and Raspberry Pi. Let me attempt to simplify it:</p>

        <p>The AI Agent Host is essentially a setup that allows you to run AI applications directly on a Raspberry Pi, which is a small, low-cost computer often used in various tech projects.</p>
            
        <p>The AI Agent Host functions as a "host" for an AI "agent". These applications can interact with live data, coming from either online sources (APIs) or the Raspberry Pi's own sensors, to make decisions or predictions.</p>
            
        <p>Moreover, the AI Agent Host is designed to be modular, which means you can add or remove different components depending on what your project needs. For example, if you need a specific database or visualization tool, you can add it to the setup.</p>
            
        <p>Also, you can use this setup in combination with a powerful GPU server. So, if you have tasks that are too demanding for the Raspberry Pi, you can send them to this server for processing. This is made possible with the inclusion of VSCode and remote connection to a JupyterHub installed on the GPU server.</p>
            
        <p>Finally, the AI Agent Host uses lightweight services like QuestDB and Grafana, suitable for the Raspberry Pi's limited resources, and is optimized for Raspberry Pi OS and DietPi, a lightweight operating system ideal for single-board computers like Raspberry Pi.</p>
            
        <p>I hope this explanation helps simplify the concept of the AI Agent Host. If you have any further questions or if something is still unclear, feel free to ask!</p>

        <!-- Key Features -->
        <div class="features-title">Key Features</div>
        <p>The AI Agent Host, designed specifically for AI development, offers several key features making it an ideal solution for Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, especially when running DietPi OS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item">Modular Environment: The AI Agent Host is built as a module-based system, allowing different components to be added or removed based on the requirements of the project. This is perfect for the customizable nature of Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, by adding an AI Agent container, the AI Agent Host can be transformed into an AI Agent Lab, expanding its capabilities for AI development and experimentation.

            </li>
            <li class="list-item">Live Data Interaction:  With the ability to work with live data from both APIs and Raspberry Pi's own sensors, AI Agent Host becomes a powerful tool for real-time data analysis, modeling, and decision-making.</li>
